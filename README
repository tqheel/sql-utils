This is a collection of utility scripts for MS SQL Server.

These scripts are largely based on the work of others and were compiled from various sources on the web.

Where I could recall where I got a script, I have left credit intact in the script body.

If you recognize your work and it is not credited, please let me know and I will be happy to add it.

These scripts are from me to you and you are free to do with them as you like. Use them at your own risk.

With great power comes great responsibility, you know.

Live Long and Prosper,

TQ
